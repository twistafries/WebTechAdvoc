	  <p class="about_p3">The residents are already accustomed on throwing their garbage in a specific time in the community. Residents separate biodegradable waste from non-biodegradable ones. The barangay has many specific areas   to place these garbage. The schedule of the throwing of garbage in the community is during Thursday, strictly from 5pm up to 9pm. Some residents along the road place their garbage in front of their respective homes. It should     not take them to place their garbage until the next day. Failure to do so will be fined and should pay an amount of money. The garbage collectors then gather these segregated garbage.</p>	  
  	  <p class="about_p4">The residents have a good habit of segregating their garbage and are responsible enough to take care of the environment they live in. They take part of their duty to the   community.</p>

	    <h2 class="about_t">For The Environment</h2>
	      <p class="about_p5">The spread of unmanaged waste and rubbish is a key detriment to the environment. Waste that is not dealt with effectively, and left to rot in big piles in the open, can lead to air and water pollution   which is harmful for the environment and any living organisms that have to deal with the repercussions of the pollution. Not only these, but when a natural area is the victim of widespread littering and rubbish dumping, t  he   area ceases to sustain its natural beauty.</p>  
	  	  <p class="about_p5">We have all bared witness to the destruction of what would have been a beautiful natural landscape by the dumping of waste. By having an effective waste management plan, which either disposes of the waste   properly or recycles it efficiently, you are doing the environment a huge favour in a time when we need it most.</p>  
  		<h2 class="about_t">For Our Health</h2>
		  <p class="about_p5">As humans, we create far more waste than any other living organism on the planet, and we are also susceptible to its backlash if we don’t deal with it properly. If waste and rubbish that has not been   properly disposed of or recycled becomes too prominent it can begin to cause air and water pollution, thus posing a great threat of bugs and virus to people worldwide.</p>  
		  <p class="about_p5">Waterborne diseases such as gastro and cholera can form when an area of water is contaminated with waste, having an effective waste management plan greatly reduces the risk of the spread of disease.</p>
		  <p class="about_p5">These are the two greatest reasons why we should be more consciences of proper waste management: the environment and the health of humans and other living organisms, and it is time we acted on it with far   greater efficiency than ever before.</p>
