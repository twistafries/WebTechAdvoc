"The separation of Church and State shall be inviolable." - 1987 Constitution of the Philippines, Article II, Section 6

"No law shall be made respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof. 
The free exercise and enjoyment of religious profession and worship, without discrimination or preference, shall forever be allowed. 
No religious test shall be required for the exercise of civil or political rights."
- Article III, Section 5

Religious Tolerance in the Philippines

Around 80% of the Philippine population consists of Roman Catholics, with the rest belonging to either Islam, or other denominations of Christianity.<a href = "https://psa.gov.ph/sites/default/files/2015%20PSY%20PDF.pdf#56" > * </a>

Religious Tolerance, as a social issue, is not as prominent or impactful in most of the country (with a few exceptions) as most denominations have enough overlapping beliefs to intermingle cordially, or have members keeping mostly to themselves and other members of their religious communities.

Bakakeng Norte is no exception. It is a barangay in Baguio City, home to a largely-Catholic community.
