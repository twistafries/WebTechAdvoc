This advocacy website was created and designed by IT students of St. Louis University. This site, based on Religious Tolerance, is one of three advocacies selected by our group, 
with the other two being Animal Welfare and Environmental Care. 

We are focusing on Bakakeng Norte, a barangay in Baguio City close to our university, bordering Marcos Highway. 

This particular advocacy site is written and maintained by Faypon, J.P. and Lansangan, P. with all text and other media created by the members of the group unless otherwise noted and/or credited.
