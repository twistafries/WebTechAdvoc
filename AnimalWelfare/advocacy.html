		This advocacy is about the roosters or chickens that are being used in gambling particularly "cockfights".
		Even though this kind of games are already known as a sport to some other places, it is still inappropriate
		that people are using their pet animals to gain money. One possible effect of this game is also death of the
		rooster.

        <h4 class="adtitle">BREAK THE CHAINS!</h4>
        <p class="adcon">
		People are already aware of the "Aso mo, Tali mo" rule but for the citizens of Bakakeng Norte their pet dogs
		are more free. It is always important for the pet owners to be responsible in how they would train their pets,
		and a lot of people claim that putting your pet dog in chains would have an effect of its behaviour. So for
		some reasons people prefer their pet dog to be free as long as it is inside their property. For people who doesn't
		have enough space for their dog to run around, they prefer using cages.
